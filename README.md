# Handwritten-digit-Recognition-by comparing ML &-Deep-Learning Algorithms
Requirements:
  numpy,
 Tensorflow,
 Spyder/Jupiter
 
 
 
 Download CSV files from famous MNIST dataset.
  train.csv and
  test.csv
 
I compared this model by using Machine Learning algorithms such as SVM,Decision tree classifier and Deep learning techniques like Convolution Neural Networks with the help of Handwritten MNIST Digits.So by comparing with some parameters like Accuracy and Timelapse we choose CNN is the best approach to implement the Digit recognition.
